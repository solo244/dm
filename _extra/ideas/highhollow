A curse upon this place. In it's place fear the maze.
I will turn you into the best of liar as it learns your greatest desire.

1. Curiousity
The first room has a painting. Written on it: For her, 2600 -> code for later. It's a reference to death as this person made a deal with her. He is one of the Shibukai and didn't want to die. He has now learned immortality.

2. Memory
Main room with a moving maze and zombies. You need to count how many zombies you have killed as that number will be used somewhere later. (6)
---
3. Intelligence
Bigger hallway end up at a face of something. It explains that the only way out is to prove that you are worthy being here. If you cannot leave its because you don't want to. Your greatest need is to be here and do something. Only the driven or the lost are drown to this place. Above the door are the words, "The password is not". The trick here is that the players aren't the ones that have to say the password, the door is. They have to get the door to say it.

4. Logic
There are 4 Doors, with above it some text: "At night they come without being fetched, And by day they are lost without being stolen.” Only in complete darkness is the correct door highlighted by stars close to it, it's the 5th door that the players cannot see. If the players go trough any of the other doors, they will find zombies. These zombies will slowly walk up, closing down the room itself.

Puzzle 2: Gravity Room

"You walk into a room that is 80ft by 80ft and filled with crates, anvils, steel chests and large sacks. Upon closer inspection, the chests are locked and the sacks and crates contain metal ingots and blacksmithing tools. You also notice that the walls are covered in spikes. At the very center of the room is a dial with a single hand pointing at 12:00. The dial contains a single key hole and four keys tethered to the dial by chains. Markings on the dial are similar to a 12hr clock. At the far end of the room is a iron reinforced door."



This puzzle is a logistics puzzle - how do you open the door. The dial in the very center is hooked up to an elaborate mechanism that controls gravity within the room. There are four keys. Each key will turn the dial in a different direction at a different rate. The first key might turn the dial clock wise 15 minutes, the second will turn it counter-clockwise by 25 minutes, etc. At each turn, the room's gravity shifts to the direction the arrow is pointing. The first few turns the gravity is weak and requires a minor balance check or reflex save. The smaller items and boxes in the room slowly move but stop eventually due to friction. A few more attempts later, the gravity increases, raising the DC of balance and reflex saves. Larger items start to move. A few more attempts later, gravity is in full force and the DC is hard. All objects, including anvils and iron chests fly across the room hitting players in their path, knocking them towards the wall. If the players fail their saves, they move as if an object, slamming into the spiky wall. One way to open the door is to grab the heaviest of the objects, such as an anvil, and align the dial in a direction so that the anvil flies into the door, breaking it open. It would need at least 50ft of travel to build up enough inertia to break the door. The gravity does not stop after it was shifted, which might require a series of balance and climb checks to move against it.

Tesser-mirror-act: There is a mirror on the wall. It can be removed from the wall, but is just a bit too large to remove from the room without breaking it. The mirror appears to show a reflection of the room (complete with reflected characters), but if it is moved, it will be seen to be a magic portal into another room. It can be placed on all four walls, as well as the ceiling and floor, and on each wall it opens into a different chamber. The mirror is the only way to reach these chambers. A character can step through the mirror, like quicksilver, but will find that the party's "evil twins" are in the room in the mirror. -- And his "evil twin" exits just as he was entering. The evil twins will attack the party instantly, but any attacks on a twin also affect the real character, and vice versa. If one dies, the other dies. (How to deal with this, I have no idea!) Each of the six rooms has a piece of a key, and when all six parts are assembled, it leads somewhere else. If the mirror is broken, the rooms become inaccessable, but the evil twins will continue to stalk the party through mirrors and reflections.

Treasure Trick: A chest in the room is empty. There is a mirror on the wall, that shows everything to be normal, except that the chest contains treasures and magic items. As the party watches in the mirror, and old man comes and removes an item from the mirror-chest and leaves again. He does this repeatedly until the chest is empty, at which time he points at the party and laughs hysterically. If the mirror is tilted on its side, the remaining treasure will spill out of the chest upon the floor, both in the mirror and in reality. If the old man is present when this happens, he will also fall down and appear in the room, where he will answer one question truthfully (with a cryptic riddle of course) before cackling and disappearing in a puff of smoke.

17) The party is traversing through a sacred temple. As they try to gain access to deeper sections of the temple, they must first approach an alter and a statue with a hand to its ear, nearby are the instructions written "Only a pure of heart and mind may pass. Confess what darkens your heart, what haunts your dreams, and what regret falters your step." The idea is that one by one the party must speak aloud (or whisper) to the statue their character's darkest secret (Make sure you as the DM at least knows this). Once everyone has shared, the way beyond opens and they can continue on through the temple. Later, have them face a Chain devil with Unnerving Mask that embodies each characters' deepest regrets.

Puzzle 3: None May Pass

"In this 50ft by 50ft room stands a Minotaur holding a large axe. He guards a door on the other end. When approached, he says in a booming voice 'None may pass!'. He sighs and seems overly bored with his duty of guarding a simple door. When approached again, he seems favourable to negotiation and offers a challenge to the players. 'Challenge me brave adventurers, to a game of arms and wits. Fight me, amuse me. You (pointing to one player) shall fight me standing on one leg. You (pointing to another) shall fight me with your eyes closed. You (another player) will fight me with one arm tied behind your back. And you (last player) shall fight me facing east.' With a flick of his wrist, the tiles on the floor glow red and blue."



You might want to scale the Minotaur's HD to make it challenging for the party. The player with only one leg needs balance checks, the one with only one arm might need a different weapon, the one with eye closed will blind fight, and the one facing east must make some difficult checks when swinging. The tiles are what make this puzzle a bit more difficult. The blue tiles teleport whatever weapon they are using to a random location. The red ones teleport the armor or shield their wearing off their backs and to a random location. Not all tiles are colored, but they do change every 2-3 rounds. To jump off one before it changes requires a reflex save. When the Minotaur is near death or the battle takes too long, he calls stop and the encounter is over. He opens the door for them and lets them through. The point is to soften up the players and not kill them.
