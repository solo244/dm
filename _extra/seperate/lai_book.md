## The book has 4 chapters
### Chapter1: The order
- A long time ago, the first paladin of great power, was seeking retribution against all evil he could find. But in a battle with an evil so powerful it was unable to be defeated, he looked for divine intervention. His god told him to train and await a strong ally. An ally in the form of a band of brothers. He would have to train and practice patience, as he was no match to face the evil alone.

### Chapter 2: Faith
- Faith would prove to be his strongest ally. As he trained, he witnesses the death and destruction of many innocent beings. Feeling the betrayal of his god, he picked up the sword and came to the rescue of many innocent people. He could not stand by and witness as more and more fell victim to this evil. Bu when a confrontation came, it wasn't him who saved the day. He has defeated by this stronger evil, but before it could finish the job, a group of strong individuals came to the rescue and banished the evil to a place it would not be able to escape from.

### Chapter 3: To Guard
- Because pure evil can never really be defeated, the paladin convinced the group to create something this was then known as the order. It was created to protect the weak and prevent evil to rule the land once more. The cost of joining this order was a great one, as members did not have a life of their own and they would be sworn to always fight evil, no matter the cost. They quickly learned by a godly omen that a great evil would escape it's prison. A great evil, that was defeated during the great war.

### Chapter 4: The Return
- A group called the Guardians had defeated this evil and swore to keep it out of this world. But the prophecy also predicted that this quest would leave the Guardians broken, and there would exists a time where the end of the world would be a reality. It would be up to the order help another group of questing adventurers to prevent the unthinkable to happen and to banish all evil back into the void.
