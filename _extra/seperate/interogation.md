Chained and can't move + guards

RO walks in

Interrogation, what do you know and who are you?

Nala -> sure, doesn't believe

Giant has been captured

Zilkas is there with an amulet but as a guard -> says weeee to her

Zilkas and Nala talk and he explains whats up

He explains the basics but can't say to much

He'll get her out of here, with most of her stuff. He changed it into a weapon

He'll distract the guards, they have to fight Ro, because he'll sense Zilkas, but he wants Nala dn Giant to escape and will sacrifice hjimself if needed

Giant and Nala will have 50 seconds when they get out before they are found. Why, no idea, but a seekers told him

What Nala can find out:
- Giant is an enforcer
- Other enforcers
- Guardians has enforcers
- Guardians are the good guys
- The great evil has henchman looking for the shields
- Mercenaries are looking for the swords
- Khordaldrum are group of assassins
- Time jumping to save the world
- Guardians were brought together long time ago
- Guardians become immortal from time and don't age anymore -> blessed by the amulet
- Zilkas has two amulets, his and another
