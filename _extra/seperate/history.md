###The Great War

Big war too long ago to remember between good and evil (the war of mountains -> actually a wrong translation: the mountain war, because it was fought on a mountain which was back at the time the great volcano of the land).

###Sitation before the war:

Dwarves/humans and elves all live on the same plane but not together. They kinda hate each other. They fight there own evils and fight for more land, money and power or to restore ballance. The evils are either stupid, weak or not organised. But there was one Lynch King with an unknown name who gathered all the evil and started taking out famous cities of the elves. The elves asked for help from humans and dwarves but they did not respond. The elves where cursed of their lands and started to disappear from existense. An alliance was made when they came to get the city of the humans on the condition that the humans would give acces to the great lands (and mountains) then owned by the dwarves. In the great war the good guys won with tree dwarves in the front lines and many humans fell. The tree main dwarves died with their shields being imbuned with the dark magic from the Lynch King. Their shield fomred a portal to trap the Lynch King from excsistence to another dimension. Nobody knows where the drawve shields teleports to but many say that they open up a portal to hell. The three dwarves died with their shields buried with them in the tombs. When the Lynch King died, his apprenctice tried to take over and get the shields back. Because of their demise the evil wasnt strong enough and sorta disappaered from the lands. The two humans at the front lines that were high ranked both survived and one of them became King. The other was a sorceror and kinda disappared from everyones radar after the fight was over. He was presumed to be hidden somewhere doing good for other people. His tomb (out of respect is therefor presumed to be empty).

###Situation after the war:

The dungeon locations are unknown of the dwarves. They've kept secret to prevent people to steal the shield and make the portals. The one human that survived the great war has found way to be immortal and now wants the shield to be able to open up the portal and summon the great Lynch King back and become King of the realms while the Lynch King follows his own agenda. The Apprentice and the evil human King want to summon this power to destroy the world.
