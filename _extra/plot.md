_Nala Tharandreal:_

She has forseen the future and it's grim. The Lych has been brought back to life using the shields and the guardians have failed. She traveled back in time to make sure this didn't happen. But in doing so, she would have to sacrifice a lot. Time warps and jumps allow the user to travel in space as well as time but this was full blow time travel. And as in line with the alter self, no doubles can exists, making it possible to only exist once. Her memory is no more, but she has a book however, that she wrote and that fellow people used and wrote into, as it was brought back even further in time. This way it would find Nala and would be filled with information she would need.
