Riding toward Goldhaven, and then the party met Zilkas. First he was hiding but Nala went up to talk to him.

He helped her to find out what her wizard book does (by writing in it).

Zilkas wants to sell her infinite rope for 2000gp or to go to Golhaven and talk to shorty to sort his problems with him.

Shorty is the shortest guy in Goldhaven and he got swindled by Zilkas, something about a pony.

Zilkas promeses more stuff if they meet the giant, the tallest guy in Goldhaven. Ogre with a scar on his left cheek and he was going to give Nala something that she had to bring back but she's not allowed to look at it.

Party goes to Goldhaven and their path is blocked by two ogres. A fight emerges. 

A fog is cast and the party is triumpant. Lai uses the crystal and 9 maggicle maissles burst outwards, killing the goblin archers around the party.

Lai uses the crystal and the ogre starts flying.

Zilkas also gave Nala a bracelet.

After the ogres, the road the party is on, is higher then the road parrallel next to it. They meet an orc group.

A couple of orcs notice the party and Nala turns into an orc and acts like the party is captured and her prisoner.

Nala talks in orcish and convinces them to talk to the boss. One orc goes with Nala and one orc stays behind.

Lai falls down to trick him close and burns his face off, leaving him to scream and alert all the orcs near the party.

Nala has angered the gods of luck and the party gets into trouble. Lai uses Thunderwave and Ottan takes the full force and is incapacitated.

Nala rips the bracelet, whilst touching the party and they time jump back to the fight with the ogres but they end up next to fight more in the forest.

They hear an explosion and are lured to Zilkas hut as he suspect they are down with their task.

He seems to be an old man now. He explains he always was, but potions are keeping him young.

The party ask his guidence as he provides them with another bracelet and a potion of water breathing x3.

Zilkas explains the tracker around Ottans neck.

The party retrives their horses and meets up with him later.

He pops up from a box of infinite water and hands Nala the pocket watch before disappearing.

The party continues on the other road and see orc graveyard.

Orb:

Walk on road for ages and Nala and Lai see themselves fight and move, color and black and white.

Ottan is in black and white, and more copies move different ways.

Nala goes right and Lai goes left.

Ro is on the horse and Mordred on back, sees Lai and smirks, attack Lai.

At the same time Nala goes right and talks to Ottan. The same things transpire but Nala stabs orc in back and time stops, kicked out of orb.

Ottand Nala realise Lai is in danger and Nala grabs the orb, waking up Lai.

The party goes left and see an orc graveyard.

Orbs gets used again, paralising Lai and Nala. They feel a ying yang struggle.

Ottan tries to get the orb away.

The touches her amulet and it guides her to touch the orb and she grabs Mordred out of the orb.

Ottan suffers necrotic damage as Mordred drains her life force.

Cracks in the floor and reality is cracking. A rift appears. Ro pops out, bleedig and hurt but no Zilkas, assumed K.I.A

Excaliber, golden piocket watch, Cavemail, Ro, The entity, clarent
