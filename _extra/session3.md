Lai escapes the Orcs and finds his way back to the cave where Nala and Thia were resting

Ottan went back to take care of Jeff and to make sure she would be fine to continue their journey

Lai reaches the party and tell his story, only to rest minutes later

Thia and Nala discover a magicly hidden trap door, and decide to open it

Nala, stepping in the low pit like elevator gets entangled and her and Thia get taken down for a good 10 minutes

They find a cave with two frozen stone skeletons

Lai gets back and makes his way down the steep tunnel

The skeletons follow the sword Nala is holding and they follow her limited spoken commands

The three explore the cave only to stumble upon goblins, orcs, armored bears and an orc shaman

The party fights off the first group of enemies but then decides to pull back

Lai blows his horn when the pary is up, cuasing a collapse and a collpased cave

The party now heads to Silverfort
