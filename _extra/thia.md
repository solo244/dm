What happened to Thia and Li

--

You felt that you needed to stay in Silverfort a little bit longer. You cannot put 

your finger on it but you felt III's spirit asking you to stay.

-> You were guided to a specific house in Silverfort and go inside

You find secret room

Room with special items: glasses to read Izzy's book

This seemed like conspiracy of information

You go into dream state and witness what happened here

III was here and talking about end of world

III didnt understand why she was chosen and why she had to leave people behind?

III was in danger but she coudlnt tell anyone or they would hurt them, so she kept 

it from Thia

But III wanted to get a message ou to Thia and all of a sudden she starts talking to 

Thia trought the dream, as if she could see her (assassins creed)

Lears about the guardians

Person that III is talking too is Nala in the future
