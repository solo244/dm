What happened to Thia and Li

--

The moment you were all riding out of town, you noticed a strong feeling. You needed to stay behind. It felt like you had unfinished business in Silverfort. Maybe business that you need to take care of yourself. However much you felt like you shouldn't leave the party, it wasn't a matter of choice. 

You jumped of the horse and Lai seemed not to care to much about it. You turned around and started making your way back to Silverfort. You had a gut feeling of where to go and ended up in one of the districts of the lower class to, what seemed to be, a random house in a random street. You try the door,.. it's open.

It was dirty and dark. There were few furntiure around and it didn't seem to have been lived in for quit some time. You wondered what had brought you here. Suddenly you felt a voice. A fimiliar voice. But it felt impossible. Eddy's voice softly guided you to a book, slighty tilted forward, sitting next to a whole row of perfectly straight books. You pull it just enough to feel a slight click and with a slow but heavy sound, a stone from one of the walls starts to move. Ever so slowly.

Entering this room feels like entering a room of conspiricy, fed by dellision and information, mystery and chaos. You can hardly make out all the scribbling on the wall, the papers pinned to it. Pieces of paper wiht some sort of code written on the front and back. This room feels like it has secrets, secrets that might be dangerous.

Room with special items: glasses to read Izzy's book

This seemed like conspiracy of information
