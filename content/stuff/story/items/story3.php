<p><strong><!-- Class-->  Mordred The Traitor
</strong></p><p>
<!-- Story -->            Grants a magical bonus for traps and spells - purple. Is the sword best used to amplify magic. Every time it is used, it unleashes it's destructive power and sends a beacon to all magic seners of its location. It doubles the damage on magic rolls but has a tendancy to be unpredictable. This grows if you use it more. At some point - uncontrolable.
