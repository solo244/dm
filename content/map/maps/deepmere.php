<p><strong>Has a bounty hunting board!!</strong></p>
<p>Deepmere has been a calm city that has been kept safe because of dwarfs for quiet some time. It's a business heavy place and the stuff you do there is mostly fair, as guards roam the entire city. It's still a bit new but because of dwarven ingenuity it seems to have grown in a very fast paste.</p>
