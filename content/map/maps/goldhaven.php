<p>This used to be a great city, know for its supplies of magic. But ever since the King Of Faredeep has claimed magic to be governed, this city has come under siege of the government. Soon bandits and evils joined the fight and the city became a battleground only used by the hardest of criminals. Years later, it's now a place to live if you have nowhere else to go or if you want to see something soo illegal.</p>
