<p><strong>The Fat Pony</strong></p>

<p>Known for its social mixture of all races, Silverfort might be one of the nicer, and very commercial forts. The guards mostly likely to not trust or belive you, as blackmail is a very common thing in this city amongst even the honest of people.</p>
<p>The city even has a darker side to it where the guards do not come and check unless they feel like a persons lif is at risk.</p>
