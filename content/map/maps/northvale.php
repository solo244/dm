<p>One of the main harbors that hosts a lot of shipping veseels, as well as military ships. A lot of merchants and armies pass on trough and there for its not really a nice place to rest or stay. People are rude and consistenly suspecious. The main trade includes everything fish and sea worthy, but the amount of corruption is high. A lot of taxes need to be paid to rent a boat and get somewhere. On top of that, a lot of bribes are needed to get you pretty much anything.</p>
