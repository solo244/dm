As a consequense he is easy to fool and backstab. But he will not let the party pass if they have orc company or not proove to him that they are worthy by figthing him in a duel.

<!-- Surprise -->
Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of Cloth +3. However, the armor is cursed. It works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually serves to attract ranged weapons.
