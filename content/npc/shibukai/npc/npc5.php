When doc found out he attacked him but was ambushed by his group and captured alive. He was stripped of his legs and arms and burried alive to spend his remains minutes alone under ground. While being burries he started being eated by mutated worms that also started mutating him. His body adjusted and he was able to survive. Therefor, he cannot be killed other then a special weapon that was made the same mutation as the worms. He’s also called the zombie because he is basicly a walking corpse.
