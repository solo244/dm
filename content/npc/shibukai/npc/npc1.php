He inherited a lot of money from family deaths (died fighting in wars) en had everything he needed to start and buy house/company (farm). When his land was overrun by hobgoblins and orcs he was taken to an overlord (one of the great evils minions) and was forced to fight in an evil humans army. Promised that his family was going to be spared. When coming back from a missions his family was captured by the same orcs and killed in front of him. Going in a bezerk rage he vouched to never die to avenge them. He had to sell his soul for this. He works for the Lynch king to eventually get close to him to kill him (secretly).
